This is a matrix wall,
-The character will fall downwards the 'Y' axis
-The character are generated Randomely.
-To look better I scaled the character with 0.80.
-All global variable are define in "MatrixHeader(Abhishek).h" file.
-To look like a column I shifted a character upwards to the 'Y' axis and translate the column   downwards to the 'Y' axis.
- The  "DrawSevenSegment()" write to design the character accourding to the "rand()".
